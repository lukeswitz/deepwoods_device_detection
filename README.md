Deepwoods Device Detection
Deepwoods Device Detection is a security and monitoring project built around the XIAO ESP32 C3 and the Heltec LoRa V3. The device is designed to perform an initial baseline scan of nearby Bluetooth (BT/BLE) and WiFi devices for 7 minutes upon boot, whitelisting every device detected. After the baseline period, it continuously scans for new devices and sends an alert over UART to Meshtastic if any non-whitelisted device is detected.

Overview
Initial Scan: Upon powering on, the device scans for Bluetooth (BT/BLE) and WiFi devices for a total of 7 minutes.
Whitelisting: Every device detected during the initial scan is automatically whitelisted.
Continuous Monitoring: After the baseline scan, the board continues scanning for both Bluetooth and WiFi.
Alert System: If a device that was not captured in the baseline scan (i.e., a non-whitelisted device) is detected during continuous monitoring, an alert message is sent via UART to a connected Meshtastic device.
Features
Automated Baseline Detection: Simplifies device management by automatically whitelisting known devices.
Real-Time Monitoring: Keeps an ongoing check on the environment for any unauthorized device appearances.
Alert Integration: Seamlessly integrates with Meshtastic through UART, allowing for prompt notifications.
Dual Wireless Support: Utilizes both Bluetooth (BT/BLE) and WiFi scanning for comprehensive coverage.
Hardware Requirements
XIAO ESP32 C3: Serves as the main controller and wireless scanning unit.
Heltec LoRa V3: Provides LoRa connectivity and integrates with the device for Meshtastic alerts.
Additional Components: Mesh Detect board
Software
Firmware: The firmware is written in C/C++ for the ESP32 environment.
UART Communication: Configured for sending alert messages to the Meshtastic device.
Wireless Libraries: Utilizes libraries for Bluetooth, BLE, and WiFi scanning.
Setup & Installation
Firmware Installation:

Clone this repository.
Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., Arduino IDE or PlatformIO).
Compile and flash the firmware onto the XIAO ESP32 C3.
Verify that the device successfully boots and begins the initial 7-minute scan.
Configuration:

Modify any configuration parameters (e.g., scan duration, UART settings) in the configuration files if necessary.
Customize the whitelist behavior as needed.
How It Works
Boot Sequence: On power-up, the device begins a 7-minute scan across Bluetooth and WiFi frequencies.
Whitelisting Process: Every device detected during this period is stored in a whitelist.
Continuous Monitoring: Once the baseline period ends, the device continues to scan both Bluetooth and WiFi channels.
Alert Trigger: Detection of any device not present in the initial whitelist triggers an alert message sent over UART to the connected Meshtastic device.
Meshtastic Integration: The alert mechanism allows for real-time notifications, leveraging the Meshtastic network for broader message dissemination.
