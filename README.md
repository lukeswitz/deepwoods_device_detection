# Deepwoods Device Detection
Deepwoods Device Detection is a security and monitoring project built around the **XIAO ESP32 C3/S3** and the **Heltec LoRa V3**. The device is designed to perform an initial baseline scan of nearby Bluetooth (BT/BLE) and WiFi devices for 7 minutes upon boot, whitelisting every device detected. After the baseline period, it continuously scans for new devices and sends an alert over UART to Meshtastic if any non-whitelisted device is detected.

## üöÄ **Overview**

### üïí **Initial Scan**
- Upon powering on, the device scans for Bluetooth (BT/BLE) and WiFi devices for a total of **7 minutes**.

### ‚úÖ **Whitelisting**
- Every device detected during the initial scan is automatically whitelisted.

### üîç **Continuous Monitoring**
- After the baseline scan, the board continues scanning for both Bluetooth and WiFi.

### üö® **Alert System**
- If a device that was not captured in the baseline scan (i.e., a non-whitelisted device) is detected during continuous monitoring, an alert message is sent via **UART** to a connected **Meshtastic** device.

## ‚ú® **Features**

- **Automated Baseline Detection:** Simplifies device management by automatically whitelisting known devices.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Keeps an ongoing check on the environment for any unauthorized device appearances.
- **Alert Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with Meshtastic through UART, allowing for prompt notifications.
- **Dual Wireless Support:** Utilizes both Bluetooth (BT/BLE) and WiFi scanning for comprehensive coverage.

## üõ† **Hardware Requirements**

- **XIAO ESP32 S3:** Serves as the main controller and wireless scanning unit. If you need to flash a xiao esp32 s3, the binary is in the esp32-s3 Version folder. 
- **Heltec LoRa V3:** Provides LoRa connectivity and integrates with the device for Meshtastic alerts.
- **Additional Components:** Mesh Detect board

## üíª **Software**

- **Firmware:** The firmware is written in **C/C++** for the ESP32 environment.
- **UART Communication:** Configured for sending alert messages to the Meshtastic device.
- **Wireless Libraries:** Utilizes libraries for **Bluetooth**, **BLE**, and **WiFi** scanning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Setup & Installation**

### **Firmware Installation:**

1. **Clone this repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/colonelpanichacks/deepwoods-device-detection.git
```

2. **Open the project** in your favorite IDE (e.g., **Arduino IDE** or **PlatformIO**).

3. **Compile and flash the firmware** onto the **XIAO ESP32 s3**.

4. **Verify** that the device successfully boots and begins the initial **7-minute scan**.

### **Configuration:**

- **Modify any configuration parameters:** (e.g., scan duration, UART settings) in the configuration files if necessary.
- **Customize the whitelist behavior** as needed.

## üîß **How It Works**

1. **Boot Sequence:** On power-up, the device begins a **7-minute scan** across Bluetooth and WiFi frequencies.

2. **Whitelisting Process:** Every device detected during this period is stored in a whitelist.

3. **Continuous Monitoring:** Once the baseline period ends, the device continues to scan both Bluetooth and WiFi channels.

4. **Alert Trigger:** Detection of any device not present in the initial whitelist triggers an alert message sent over **UART** to the connected **Meshtastic** device.

5. **Meshtastic Integration:** The alert mechanism allows for **real-time notifications**, leveraging the Meshtastic network for broader message dissemination.
